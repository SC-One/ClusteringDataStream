Totaly, if you want to start the service (that is necessary if you want to use a C++ client or a Python client; both codes are available):
## start service: 
```
cd DemoApp/Service/
python Service.py
```
### start clients
- if you want start C++ client (interactive client) , you should build the project in folder `DemoApp/DataStreamClusteringDemo/` -> `CMakeLists.txt`
- if you want start python client (random generate), run:
  ```
  cd DemoApp/Service/
  python Client.py
  ```
## standalone run
```
cd DemoApp/Service/
python StandAloneTest.py
```
